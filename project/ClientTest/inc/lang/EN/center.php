	'RULE0' =>'Casino play involves three or six 52-card decks shuffled together and dealt from a dealing box called a “shoe.” Players aim for a total count of nine, or as close as they can get, in a hand of two or three cards. Face (court) cards and 10s are counted as zero; all others take their index value. The cards in each hand are added to obtain the value, but only the last digit is significant. Thus, if the two cards in a hand are 8 and 5, the count is not 13 but 3. A competing hand with a face card (zero) and a 6 wins because it is closer to a count of nine.',
	'GAMEHOWTOPLAY' =>'How to play',
	'RULE1' =>'The first rule, that actually overrides all the other rules, states that a third card can be dealt if the player or the banker has a total score of 8 or 9 and they both stand.
	In case the player\'s total is 5 or less, the player is supposed to hit. If the total is more than 5, the player stands and vice versa. If the player stands, the banker hits provided that the total is 5 or less.
	Winning bets on banker or player are paid 1:1, but you have to be informed that a 5% commission is charged on bank bets, in which case the odds slightly change from 0.95 to 1. You will notice that the dealer keeps track of the commission you owe with small laminated markers. The commission is collected at the end of each shoe.
	As for the tie bets, the payout might vary from casino to casino. Yet, in most cases, they are paid 8:1 or 9:1. If the hand ends a tie, the player and the banker get a refund of their bets. Once the player places a bet, it cannot be amended. The player and the banker\'s hands are dealt in accordance with the established rules.',
